##Introduction

In this page, I show the projects related data science and Data visulaization using D3 package. 

## Data visualization in 10 ways
About same data set, I use 10 different ways to present 10 same scotter plots. In those plot, the radius vary based on its position. The color of each dot is relative different band of cars.

## Anaimation in Data Visualization

In this project, I implement animation to show different aspect of a dataset, including bar chart, scatter plot, and sorted circle elements. The animation is automatically changed.

## Data visualizaiton experiment

As human being, our cabability of recive information though our eyes is different based on the shape of the visual element. In data Visualization area, people's ability of reciving values from bar chart is better than pie chart. Because we are more comfortable to compare length than angle or area. 

In this experiment, with a partener, we recreate the classical experiment using d3.js.

##  Visualizations and Multiple Views
The information in one graph is limited. So I and one partener work out an approach to link several data visualization graph together, and all the graph will react at same time to the event generated by the users.

##Data visualization For 2017 Election
The most important even of USA in 2016 is the president campaign relative to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Before the due time for the election, no one knows the exact result, since the process was so dramatic. so we want to use the data of night on November 18th from Twitter to visualization the aptitude of the social media about the two president candidates, in order to give people a better sense of the current situation.

We also build a video for demonstrate our project. [Video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B4BL-HMTdo&feature=youtu.be)
