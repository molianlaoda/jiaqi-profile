##Introduction

In this page, I show the projects related data science and Data visulaization using D3 package. 

## Data visualization in 10 ways
About same data set, I use 10 different ways to present 10 same scotter plots. In those plot, the radius vary based on its position. The color of each dot is relative different band of cars.

## Anaimation in Data Visualization

In this project, I implement animation to show different aspect of a dataset, including bar chart, scatter plot, and sorted circle elements. The animation is automatically changed.

## Data visualizaiton experiment

As human being, our cabability of recive information though our eyes is different based on the shape of the visual element. In data Visualization area, people's ability of reciving values from bar chart is better than pie chart. Because we are more comfortable to compare length than angle or area. 

In this experiment, with a partener, we recreate the classical experiment using d3.js.
